# seedling_Classification_plants
using neural network made one predictive model that predict the seedling done in plant from 12 species present in it.
actually this model is though not complete i am still working over their 95 % work has been done rest i am still working over their i just upload it to send this file to UNSCHOOL Learning as under them i am working over this project.

1> Black-grass

8>Maize
9>Scentless Mayweed
10>Shepherds Purse
11>Small-flowered Cranesbill
12>Sugar beet

i have also provided one zip file path that you can  download that file from kaggle website for getting training and testing dataset of this model.
